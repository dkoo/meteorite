		title: 'The Trees That Grow in Brooklyn',
		body: "![Clinton Street, Brooklyn today](http://upload.dkoo.net/images/201509/trees/clinton.jpg)\n*Clinton Street, looking north from DeGraw, 2015.*\n\nI live in an area of Brooklyn where trees line almost every residential street. After living here a while, you stop noticing them—they’re just there, part of the fabric of the streets, like the brick brownstone façades, slate grey sidewalks, and streaks of dog poop every few steps. \n\nBut it’s worth stopping every now and then to acknowledge their quiet presence, not only because they tend to be beautiful, but also because of the way they’ve thrived in a place like New York, where nature can be as foreign as the concept of a drive-through Starbucks.\n\nTheir ubiquity is no accident. Take a look at photos of New York from a few generations ago, like the ones from the New York Public Library’s extensive collection on [OldNYC](https://www.oldnyc.org/), and the lack of trees is striking. The trees of Brooklyn, and all of New York City, are a success story: their ancestors were decimated by the growth of the city, and they exist in such large numbers now only because of a concerted but decades-long collective effort to [bring them back](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/nyregion/in-leafy-blitz-trees-spring-up-in-a-changing-new-york.html).\n\n![A treeless Clinton Street, Brooklyn in 1930](http://upload.dkoo.net/images/201509/trees/clinton_old.jpg)\n*Clinton Street, looking north from DeGraw, 1930. ([OldNYC](http://www.oldnyc.org/#703685f-a))*\n\nWith the help of Jill Hubley’s amazing [Map of NYC Street Trees](http://jillhubley.com/project/nyctrees/), I spent some time getting to know some of the leafy denizens of my neighborhood in Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill. Here’s what I’ve learned:\n\n# London Planetree\n\n![London Planetree](http://upload.dkoo.net/images/201509/trees/london_plane.jpg)\n\nThe London Plane holds a special honor in New York institutional life: its maple-like leaf is (possibly) the [logo for the New York City Parks & Rec department](http://www.nycgovparks.org/news/daily-plant?id=19177). It has a nice grey-green bark that flakes to form a smooth camouflage pattern, and produces small, ugly green fruit that the [Oregon Department of Forestry Publications](http://www.oregon.gov/odf/urbanforests/docs/featuredtreelondonplane.pdf) calls “butterballs” and describes as being “about the size of a Swedish meatball.”London Planes [supposedly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platanus_%C3%97_acerifolia#In_New_York_City) constitute up to 10% of all street trees in the entire city, but I couldn’t find an official source to back that up. I’d believe it, though, because I see these guys everywhere. Some particularly stately Planes line the walkways in Manhattan’s Bryant Park.\n\n# Honey Locust\n\n![Honey Locust](http://upload.dkoo.net/images/201509/trees/honey_locust.jpg)\n\nThe Honey Locust’s name sums it up pretty well: it’s a gorgeous tree with deep-green, feathery leaves that is also an [invasive weed](http://www.weeds.org.au/cgi-bin/weedident.cgi?tpl=plant.tpl&card=T13) throughout much of the world. Native to the southern United States, it grows fast and is [extremely hardy](http://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_gltr.pdf), laughing at conditions like drought, cold, road salt, alkaline soil, and insect pests that would fell less resistant species. The huge, flat bean pods it produces sound like maracas when shaken and smell like sweet honey when ripe. My dog loves sniffing them. Some varieties of Honey Locust grow dense thickets of thorns, which doesn’t seem very neighborly, but the ones in my neighborhood are thankfully thornless.\n\n# Japanese Pagoda\n\n![Japanese Pagoda](http://upload.dkoo.net/images/201509/trees/japanese_pagoda.jpg)\n\nThe Japanese Pagoda is native to China and Korea, which...of course. It grows up to about sixty-five feet tall, but also wide, and its fern-like leaves form a very large, very round head when mature. Its crown explodes with tiny cream-colored flowers in late summer, which then transform into long, yellow seed pods that hang like chains of gold beads throughout autumn. For all its beauty, its name literally means “demonwood” (槐) in Chinese, and it was often [used as a gravemarker for Buddhist monks](http://naturewalk.yale.edu/trees/fabaceae/sophora-japonica/japanese-pagoda-tree-scholar-tree-15). The last emperor of the Ming Dynasty supposedly [hanged himself off one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styphnolobium_japonicum). Its dense, wide crown forms a nice tunnel effect where it overhangs streets, even nicer when adorned with thousands of golden seed pods. All in all, a pretty pleasant neighbor despite its reputation.\n\n# Pin Oak\n\n![Pin Oak](http://upload.dkoo.net/images/201509/trees/pin_oak.jpg)\n\nA huge Pin Oak grows right outside my window, its branches and leaves brushing up against the fire escape on the front of my apartment building, and it plays host to a small army of squirrels and birds who feed on its perfect, adorable little acorns. A family of squirrels from this tree once took up residence *inside* the walls of my apartment for a year, until my wife and I forcibly evicted them using peanut butter and several no-kill traps (a story for another post, perhaps). When you walk underneath any Pin Oak in the city, squirrels may bombard you with acorns, laughing maniacally as they do it, but you can’t hear them because they’re fifty feet above your head. Because of all this, I kind of hate the Pin Oak, even though it’s a beautiful tree that doesn’t deserve any negative vibes. It’s native to these parts, which means its kind has been around much longer than we have, so we’re really the gentrifiers in this situation and should maybe feel a little guilty about that.\n\n# Ginkgo Biloba\n\n![Ginkgo Biloba](http://upload.dkoo.net/images/201509/trees/ginkgo_biloba.jpg)\n\nThe venerable ginkgo tree is easily recognizable by its tall, slender profile and distinctively cute, fan-shaped leaves. Although it’s also known flatteringly as the maidenhair tree, I refer to it affectionately as the Stinko Smelloba, because of the curiously bright green, sticky fruit that the female trees produce every autumn (yes, ginkgo trees are either male or female—although they have been known to [switch genders after grafting](http://scribol.com/environment/gingko-the-tree-that-can-change-sex)). The smell has been variably described as “[putrid cheese](http://www.wsj.com/articles/ginkgo-trees-stink-up-cities-when-seeds-fall-1416869012),” “[rancid butter](http://homeguides.sfgate.com/ginkgo-tree-berries-stink-56020.html),” “[vomit](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/10/11/ginkgo-trees-making-a-stink-in-new-york-city-parks/),” “[hot garbage, odiferous cheese, dog poop or worse](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/get-past-vile-smell-ginkgo-nuts-are-delicious-180953336/?no-ist).” Every year from October through mid-winter, the streets of Brooklyn are bathed in the ginkgo’s slimy, malodorous funk. Despite the vomitous fragrance, the fruit is supposedly [pretty tasty](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/10/the-nasty-bits-gingko-nuts.html), although I’ve never been brave enough to try it. \n\nThe ginkgo is a special plant: it may be the [oldest species of tree on the planet](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/peter_crane_history_of_ginkgo_earths_oldest_tree/2646/), having been around in some form for more than 200 million years. It’s easy to imagine dinosaurs munching on its fan leaves or digging the nuts out of its smelly berries. Originally from China, these ancient giants are [very nearly extinct](http://www.nature.com/news/2003/030619/full/news030616-9.html) in the wild, but centuries of human cultivation as ornamental plants have kept them alive for longer than they would have survived on their own—and allowed them to proliferate in cities around the world. A rare example of humans preserving a species rather than destroying it. The ginkgo is a comforting fixture in Brooklyn: the elderly, eccentric neighbor whose place always smells a bit weird, but whose presence is always a welcome sight."
